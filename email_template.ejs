  <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>
  <p>
    How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been almost <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
    since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying 
    my time. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make before the bootcamp even started!
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
    Check out my latest posts:
    <ul class="list-group">
      <% for (var i = 0; i < latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
        <li class="list-group-item"><a href=<%=latestPosts[i].post_url%>><%= latestPosts[i].title %></a></li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Talk soon,<br>
    Sean
